Use the `@database-specialist` subagent to handle the database-heavy portion of the following request. Focus on schema design, migrations, constraints, indexes, transaction boundaries, query tuning, and ORM or query-builder work where database behavior is the real concern.

If the request is ambiguous, cross-cutting, or really needs design before implementation, say so plainly and recommend `/spec` before changing the schema or queries.
