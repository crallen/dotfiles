# OpenCode

A custom suite of software engineering agents, skills, and commands designed for building software across any tech stack.

## Agent Suite

### Primary Agents

Primary agents appear in the Tab agent switcher for direct conversation.

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **tech-lead** (default) | Executing orchestrator: analyzes requests, delegates to specialists, integrates results, handles routine work directly. |
| **architect** | Collaborative design: researches goals, asks clarifying questions, produces specs with task checklists. Switch to this agent (Tab) when work needs a design step before implementation. |

The built-in **plan** agent is also available via Tab for read-only analysis.

### Specialist Subagents

These are invoked by the tech-lead via Task tool, or manually via `@mention`.

| Agent | Purpose | Permissions |
|---|---|---|
| `@code-reviewer` | Code quality and best practices review | Read-only. Cannot modify files. |
| `@security-analyst` | Security vulnerability assessment, dependency audits, threat modeling | Read-only. Cannot modify files. |
| `@tester` | Test generation, coverage analysis, test strategy | Write access. Bash allowlisted for test/build toolchains. |
| `@debugger` | Root cause analysis and systematic debugging | Write access. Bash allowlisted for repro, diagnostics, and runtime toolchains. |
| `@documenter` | Technical documentation and API docs | Write access. Bash limited to read-only commands. |
| `@devops-engineer` | Docker, CI/CD, infrastructure configuration | Write access. Bash allowlisted for infrastructure and delivery toolchains. |
| `@backend-engineer` | Backend application work: API handlers, services, auth/authz, validation, integrations, app-layer refactors | Write access. Bash allowlisted for app/runtime toolchains. |
| `@database-specialist` | Schema design, migrations, indexes, query tuning, constraints, transactions, ORM/query-builder work where database behavior matters | Write access. Bash allowlisted for database and migration toolchains. |
| `@git-manager` | Release preparation, changelog generation, and versioning-heavy git workflow | Write access. Bash limited to git, `gh`, and read commands. |
| `@frontend-engineer` | UI components, styling, accessibility, responsive design | Write access. Bash allowlisted for frontend build/test toolchains. |
| `@frontend-auditor` | Read-only frontend audit and critique for UI quality, accessibility, responsiveness, and product-specific design fit | Read-only. Cannot modify files. |
| `@agent-builder` | Creates, modifies, and reviews agents, skills, and slash commands | Write access. Bash limited to read-only commands. |
| `@agent-reviewer` | Read-only review of agents, skills, and commands for correctness, permissions, and consistency | Read-only. Cannot modify files. |

Plus the built-in subagents:

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `@explore` | Fast read-only codebase search and file discovery |
| `@general` | General-purpose multi-step research and tasks |

### Available Skills

Skills are loaded on-demand by agents via the `skill` tool. They provide detailed procedural knowledge without consuming context until needed.

| Skill | Description | Primary users |
|---|---|---|
| `coding-guardrails` | Cross-cutting execution guardrails for implementation work: assumptions, simplicity, surgical diffs, and verification | tech-lead, code-reviewer, tester, debugger, devops-engineer, frontend-engineer, backend-engineer, database-specialist |
| `spec-writing` | Scope decomposition, clarifying dialogue, approach exploration, staged design presentation, and spec self-review | architect |

| `test-strategy` | Test type selection, coverage targets, mocking guidelines | tester, tech-lead |
| `code-review-checklist` | Structured review rubric across core review categories with severity levels | code-reviewer |
| `security-analysis` | Vulnerability taxonomy, data flow analysis, dependency auditing, remediation patterns | security-analyst |
| `debugging-methodology` | Phased debugging workflow — Phase 0 builds a feedback loop (10 strategies), phases 1–5 reproduce/gather/hypothesize/test/fix, Phase 6 is cleanup and post-mortem | debugger |
| `doc-templates` | Templates for READMEs, API docs, ADRs, changelogs, code comments | documenter |

| `frontend-patterns` | Frontend router for product context gathering, work-mode selection, escalation, and targeted reference selection | frontend-engineer, frontend-auditor |
| `agent-authoring` | Schemas, templates, and conventions for creating agents, skills, and commands | agent-builder, agent-reviewer |
| `grill` | Relentless one-at-a-time interrogation of a plan — sharpens terminology, stress-tests decisions, and writes CONTEXT.md and ADRs inline as conclusions crystallize | architect |
| `architecture-review` | Architecture deepening workflow: find shallow modules, propose depth-increasing refactors, present markdown report of candidates, then grill on the chosen one with CONTEXT.md / ADR integration | architect |
| `prototype-methodology` | Throwaway prototype workflow — routes between a terminal app for logic/state questions and multiple UI variants for visual questions | architect, backend-engineer, frontend-engineer |

### Suggested Workflows

These are common starting points, not rigid rules. Pick the smallest workflow that fits the request.

| Goal | Suggested flow |
|---|---|
| Ambiguous feature or cross-cutting change | `/spec` → specialist implementation command or `tech-lead` → `/code-review` or `/security` as needed → `/test` → `/commit` |
| Straightforward backend work | `/backend-engineer` → `/test` → `/code-review` → `/commit` |
| Database-heavy change | `/database-specialist` → `/test` if applicable → `/code-review` → `/commit` |
| Frontend implementation | `/frontend` → `/frontend-polish` if needed → `/test` → `/code-review` → `/commit` |
| Frontend critique before coding | `/frontend-audit` or `/frontend-critique` → `/frontend` or `/frontend-polish` → `/test` → `/code-review` |
| Bug investigation | `/debugger` → specialist follow-up if needed → `/test` → `/code-review` → `/commit` |
| Security-sensitive change | `/spec` or implementation command → `/security` → `/test` → `/code-review` → `/commit` |
| Documentation update | `/docs` → `/code-review` if the doc change affects technical accuracy significantly → `/commit` |
| Agent/skill/command changes | `/agent-review` → `/agent-builder` → `/agent-review` → `/commit` |
| Release preparation | `/code-review` or `/test` as needed → `/release` |
| Stress-testing a plan or sharpening domain language | `/grill <plan>` → specialist implementation command → `/commit` |
| Exploring a design before committing to it | `/prototype` → `/spec` if needed → specialist implementation command → `/commit` |
| Improving codebase architecture or testability | `/zoom-out` (orient first) → `/architecture` → specialist implementation command → `/test` → `/commit` |

## General Guidelines

- Read project config and nearby code before changing anything. If `CONTEXT.md` exists at the repo root (or `CONTEXT-MAP.md` for multi-context repos), read it too — it defines the canonical domain language for that project and takes precedence over general terminology.
- For ambiguous or cross-cutting work, use `/spec` or `@architect` first. The architect is a collaborative dialogue agent — always invoke it directly, never via Task delegation.
- Skills are the canonical long-form guidance. Keep agent bodies and commands short; load only what you need. For implementation work, start with `coding-guardrails` plus the domain skill.
- Prefer deny-by-default shell permissions with role-scoped allowlists; reserve unrestricted shell access for cases that truly require it.
- Route backend application work to `@backend-engineer`; when schema, SQL, migrations, indexes, transaction behavior, or database-heavy ORM/query-builder behavior are the real concern, involve `@database-specialist`.
- For implementation work, surface assumptions, keep changes simple and scoped, and verify with explicit checks.
- Match existing conventions and prefer the smallest change that satisfies the request.
- Use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for GitHub-hosted tasks when shell access is appropriate.
- Use `/code-review`, `/security`, `/test`, `/docs`, and `/commit` as appropriate to keep quality, docs, and history clean.
- Never read `.env` files via any method.
